## CheckSyntheticCPUID
CPUID leaf is explicitly defined for hypervisors to expose their presence and vendor ID; any honest vm stack should set this up
***

## CheckCrystalClock
compare freq from crystal clock or base MHz to measured TSC freq via RDTSC againsst QueryPerformanceCounter; large mismatch suggests TSC scaling/offsetting or lazy CPUID emulation
***

## CheckKUserSharedData
calculate the delta between the shared page time and RDTSC;  large deviation suggests the OS timer and TSC/time virtualization are out of sync
***

## CheckUMIP_SGDT
modern CPUs support UMIP (User Mode Instruction Prevention), executing instructions like SGDT, SIDT and SLDT should throw a #GP exception and be emulated by the OS; should be slower and return dummy-ish values; very fast SGDT suggests UMIP is off or badly emulated; keep in mind this doesnt apply for old CPUs
